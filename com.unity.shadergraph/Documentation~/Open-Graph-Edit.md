# Open a Shader Graph Asset

If you've already [created a Shader Graph Asset](Create-Shader-Graph.md) or have an existing Shader Graph in your project, you can open the Asset for editing.

## From the Project window

To open a Shader Graph Asset from the Unity Editor's [Project window](https://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/Manual/ProjectView.html):

1. [!include[open-project-window](./snippets/sg-open-project-window.md)]

2. Find the location in your Project window's folders where you saved the Shader Graph Asset you want to edit.

3. Double-click the Shader Graph Asset to open it in the Graph window.

## Next steps

After you've opened a Shader Graph Asset, you can [create nodes](Create-New-Node.md) and [create connections](Create-Connection.md) to start designing the final output of your Shader Graph.
