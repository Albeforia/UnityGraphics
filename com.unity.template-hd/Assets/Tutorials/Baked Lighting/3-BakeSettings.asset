      Title:
        m_Untranslated: Baking settings
      Text:
        m_Untranslated: 'In the Lighting window, you can see all of the baking settings,
          they can be stored into a <b>Lighting Settings</b> asset.

          

          We
          offer 4 different assets in this template, with different levels of quality,
          which will have a direct impact on how long the bake will take: the higher
          the quality, the longer the bake.

          

          These presets
          can be found in the project under <b>Assets</b> > <b>Scenes</b> > <b>SampleScene</b>.
          The easy way to locate them is to simply click on the Lighting Settings
          field in the Lighting tab.

          

          Inspect each preset
          starting with <b>Lighting Settings Draft</b> up to <b>Lighting Settings
          Ultra</b>. Important settings to take note of:

          

          *
          <b>Lightmap Resolution</b> - controls how precise the lightmap is. Higher
          number means larger file size, slower bake, increased maximum quality.

          

          * 
          <b>Indirect and Environment samples</b> - controls how grainy or smooth
          the lighting will be. While resolution limits the max quality, the sample
          count is used to reach that maximum. Meaning if the lightmap resolution
          is low and we keep increasing sample count, the quality will not get any
          better. No effect on file size.

          

          * <b>Direct samples</b>
          - controls the quality of direct shadows. Not used in this demo, since
          all shadows are realtime. We have set different values for convenience
          if users want to switch to fully baked lighting and shadows.

          

          *<b>Max
          bounces and Min bounces</b> - controls how many times the light ray can
          bounce. A higher number brings more realism but increases baking time.

          

          *
          <b>Filtering</b> - is a complex subject, but the key takeaway is that most
          of the time using Filtering is a good idea. It will allow you to have faster
          bake times without a major impact on quality. Which method to use can depend
          on a case by case scenario, but often Optix can work better with lower
          sample counts and Open Image for higher.
