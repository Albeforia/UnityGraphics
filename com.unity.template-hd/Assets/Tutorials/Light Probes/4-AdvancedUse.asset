      Text:
        m_Untranslated: "I would like to highlight one specific use case of light
          probes in this project. Remember in the previous step we talked about not
          setting small objects as static, to save lightmap space and reduce bake
          times. If you would select objects in the tree cage, you could see that
          we are doing what we just said not to do. Why?\r\n\r\n1) In the <i>Hierarchy</i>
          windows search bar type in LOD00. The bamboo trees and the rocks should
          be filtered out\r\n\r\n2) Select any of these objects and notice in the
          <i>Inspector</i> window, they are marked as static\r\n\r\nUsually, if an
          object is marked static it will reserve space in the baked lightmap, and
          the lighting will take longer to bake. If it\u2019s not marked as static,
          the light baking and probe baking process will just ignore the object as
          if it doesn\u2019t exist.\r\n\r\nIn this specific scenario, we have a lot
          of small objects together forming a large enough group so it would impact
          traveling light within the scene. In situations like these, we can mark
          the bamboo trees as static, but in the inspector window under Lighting>Receive
          Global Illumination set Light Probes. This way trees will still receive
          lighting from light probes, but will no longer be invisible to the baking
          system, allowing them to contribute to indirect lighting.\r\n\r\nTake a
          look at the image above, more specifically at the wall right to the cage.
          Just above the line, you should notice a slight green tint, representing
          light rays passing through leaves and hitting the wall. The effect is subtle,
          but realistic graphics are mostly composed of a lot of small details forming
          a greater picture.\r\n\r\nWhile it could be a lot to take in, simply remember
          that large groups of small objects could benefit from being static + receiving
          GI from light probes. See <a href=\"https://blogs.unity3d.com/2019/08/28/static-lighting-with-light-probes/\">here</a>
          for more info about this use case.\r\n"
