        m_Untranslated: Explore light probes
      Text:
        m_Untranslated: "Let\u2019s take a look at how light probes were set up for
          this scene.\r\n\r\nTip: If you'd like to match the image above, make sure
          Gizmos are on, light probes are not selected and at the bottom of the Lighting
          window, set Light Probe Visualization to <b>All probes no cells</b>.\r\n\r\nAll
          the scene light probes can be found in <i>Hierarchy</i> window <b>Lighting</b>><b>Light
          Probe Group</b>. They were placed by hand. Select Light Probe Group and
          in the <i>Inspector</i> click <b>Edit Light Probes</b> button then you
          can select, move or add new ones.\r\n\r\nThis tutorial will not delve into
          manually placing or creating a Light Probe Group, however, we will highlight
          a few key principles to have in mind:\r\n\r\n* Light probes are not realtime,
          remember to rebake if you made drastic changes to lighting.\r\n\r\n* Spheres
          in the image above show at what points in the scene lighting data will
          be sampled. Whenever an object is set to receive lighting from light probes(default),
          the object will receive the lighting using a blend from the 4 closest probes.
          So it is important to place probes on both sides where a drastic lighting
          change is occurring, for example in a shadow and next to it.\r\n\r\n* Even
          if an object does not move, it doesn\u2019t mean it should be marked as
          static and use lightmaps. Using light probes  for stationary objects, will
          reduce baking times and lightmap sizes. For example, see the chairs in
          the third room. They are only static for reflections and receive lighting
          from probes. Generally, small objects should use light probes, not baked
          lightmaps.\r\n"
