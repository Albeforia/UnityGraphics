        m_Untranslated: Explore light probes
      Text:
        m_Untranslated: "Let\u2019s take a look at how Light Probes are set up in
          this scene.\r\n\r\nTip: If you'd like to match the image above, make sure
          Gizmos are on, light probes are not selected and at the bottom of the <b>Window</b>
          > <b>Rendering</b> > <b>Lighting</b>, set Light Probe Visualization to
          <b>All probes no cells</b>.\r\n\r\nThe Light Probe Group can be found in
          <i>Hierarchy</i> window <b>Lighting</b>><b>Light Probe Group</b>. They
          were placed by hand. Select Light Probe Group and in the <i>Inspector</i>
          click <b>Edit Light Probes</b> button to select, move or add new probes.\r\n\r\nTips:\r\n\r\n*
          Light probes are not realtime, remember to generate the lighting again
          if you made noticeable changes to the lighting.\r\n\r\n* Spheres in the
          image above show the indirect lighting sampling location. Whenever an object
          is set to receive lighting from light probes (default), the object will
          receive the lighting using a blend from the 4 closest probes. So it is
          important to increase the density of probes in areas of high lighting contrast
          to ensure more accurate interpolation between probes.\r\n\r\n* Light Probes
          are baked considerably faster than lightmaps, and Light Probe data is considerably
          smaller than lightmaps.  Therefore, it is also recommended to set smaller
          stationary objects to receive Global Illumination from Light Probes, rather
          than Lightmaps. Apart from the main structures (walls, floors, etc.), most
          objects in this scene are tagged to receive Global Illumination from Light
          Probes. This will reduce baking times and the overall memory footprint
          of the lighting.\r\n"
