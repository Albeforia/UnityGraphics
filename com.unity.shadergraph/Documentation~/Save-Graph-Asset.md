# Save your Shader Graph Asset

To avoid losing any changes you made to a Shader Graph Asset, you should save your work.

1. [!include[with-graph-open](./snippets/sg-with-graph-open.md)] do one of the following in the Graph toolbar:

    - To save your Shader Graph Asset, select **Save Asset**.
    - To change the name of your Shader Graph Asset or its location in your project, select **Save As**. Enter a new name and choose where you want to save your Asset, then select **Save**.

## Next steps

After you've saved your Shader Graph Asset, you can continue to [create nodes](Create-New-Node.md), [create connections](Create-Connection.md), or you can [add your Shader Graph to a material](Add-Graph-Material.md).
