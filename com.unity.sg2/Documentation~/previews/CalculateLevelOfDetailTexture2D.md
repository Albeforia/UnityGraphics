## Description
Computes LOD values for use with texture sample nodes.

## Inputs
**Texture** - the texture asset from which to calculate LODs
**UV** - the texture coordinates to use for the texture
**Sampler** - the texture sampler to use for the texture

## Output
**LOD** - the calculated level of detail

## Controls
**Clamp** - clamps the output to the mips on the input Texture or an ideal mip level for a texture with all mips present
