        m_Untranslated: Explore the Light Probes
      Text:
        m_Untranslated: "When working with Light Probes there are a few considerations
          to keep in mind. Below you can find few highlighted tips:\r\n\r\n\u2022
          Light Probes are not real-time, so remember to generate the lighting again
          if you have made noticeable changes to it.\r\n\r\n\u2022 The spheres in
          the image above are a visualisation of the lighting captured by the Light
          Probes at their corresponding locations. Objects are set by default to
          receive lighting from Light Probes, and will receive the lighting as a
          blend from the 4 closest probes. Therefore, it\u2019s important to increase
          the density of probes in areas of high lighting contrast to ensure more
          accurate interpolation between probes.\r\n\r\n\u2022 It\u2019s recommended
          to set smaller stationary objects to receive Global Illumination from Light
          Probes, rather than from Lightmaps. Light Probes are baked considerably
          faster than lightmaps, and Light Probe data is considerably smaller than
          that of lightmaps. Apart from the main structures (walls, floors, etc.),
          most objects in this sample Scene are tagged to receive Global Illumination
          from Light Probes. This will reduce baking times and the overall memory
          footprint of the lighting."
