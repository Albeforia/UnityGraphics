# Imposter Sample Node

## Description

Uses the UV coordinates generated by the Imposter UV node to sample an specific imposter texture. 
This creates the illusion of a 3D object on a billboard object because the imposter texture's frame changes based on the camera direction and angle.
If the imposter object has more than one texture to sample (e.g. color, normal, mask, occlusion, etc,), multiple Imposter Sample nodes can be used.

## Generated code example

[!include[nodes-generated-code](./snippets/nodes-generated-code.md)], based on the selected Mode on the Imposter Sample Node node:

### ThreeFrames

```
ImposterSample(ImposterFrames, Texture.tex, Texture.texelSize, Weights,IpmosterClip, Grid, UV0, UV1, UV2, Sampler.samplerstate, RGBA);
```

### OneFrame

```
ImposterSample_oneFrame(ImposterFrames, Texture.tex, Texture.texelSize, Weights,IpmosterClip, Grid, UV0, UV1, UV2, Sampler.samplerstate, RGBA);
```
