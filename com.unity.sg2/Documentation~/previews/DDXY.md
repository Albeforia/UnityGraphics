## Description
Calculates the sum of both partial derivatives of the input.

## Inputs
**In** - input value

## Output
**Out** - the sum of both partial derivatives of the input

## Controls
**Standard** - the standard partial derivative - typically behaves the same as Coarse
**Coarse** - a low precision derivative where each pixel quad has the same value
**Fine** - a high precision derivative where each pixel can have a unique value
